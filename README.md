# learning_code
This folder has exercises that I have done to teach myself programming languages. Within the exercises I have made notes on what specific lines of codes do, definitions of terms with examples, and remarks about other information from the courses and what I've noticed.

I created directories based on language. From there I specified which subject my code/notes relate to. So far, most of my notes comes from lessons that I've taken on Codecademy. The headers for the notes that I've taken so far and will take in the future will have the source of my lessons in it (i.e. Learning Python the Hard Way, classes I am taking in college, etc).
