JAVA, Introduction:
===================
+ Data Types are int, boolean, and char.
+ Variables are used to store values.
+ Whitespace helps make code easy to read for you and others.
+ Comments describe code and its purpose.
+ Arithmetic Operators include +, -, *, /, and %.
+ Relational Operators include <, <=, >, and >=.
+ Equality Operators include == and !=.

JAVA, Object-Orient:
====================
+ Class: a blueprint for how a data structure should function
+ Constructor: instructs the class to set up the initial state of an object
+ Object: instance of a class that stores the state of a class
+ Method: set of instructions that can be called on an object
+ Parameter: values that can be specified when creating an object or calling a method
+ Return value: specifies the data type that a method will return after it runs
+ Inheritance: allows one class to use functionality defined in another class

JAVA, Data Structures:
======================
+ For Loops: used to repeatedly run a block of code
+ For Each Loops: a concise version of a for loop
+ ArrayList: stores a list of data
+ HashMap: stores keys and associated values like a dictionary

PYTHON, Introduction:
=====================
+ Variables: which store values for later use
+ Data types: numbers, booleans, etc.
+ Whitespace: separates statements
+ Comments: makes code easier to read
+ Arithmetic: operations including +, -, *, /, **, and %
